# 3d-map

For this, I initially made a 3x3 map with streets and buildings (some of the buildings were free to use from the internet). Afterwards, I made a 5x5 map (larger scale), and I intend to use this for a car-based video game.

In addition, I also made a coin model and roadblock model for the game, since those two could be used as powerups & obstacles in the game.
